Some kind of intro about why I'm writing this and what you can take from it

## What Mendelian does as a company

Mendelian speeds up rare disease diagnosis, using tech.

Now, this seems strange to a lot of people. But, trust me, it's the best way to
describe what happens in that office. Here are a few of the follow up questions
I've heard:

### What's the product/app/service?

We've made so many things over the years, see my [highlights](#highlights).
Often concurrently. It's a bit overwhelming to list them all out. The one
thing that brings them together is that they speed up rare disease diagnosis.

Here's another answer, at the time of writing they provide a search engine, a
genetic interpretation service and a referral suggestion service.

### How do they make money?

So there's a lot of value in rare disease diagnosis. Hospitals have an interest
in providing good healthcare, pharmaceuticals have an interest in selling drugs,
and healthcare providers have an interest in ...
[QALY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year)s (ffs).

Mendelian talk to all the big players for each service and there seems to be
potential for big wins.

But they are still a start up. Like most other startups, they make money from
time to time but they need trials to pass and negotiations to finish before
they know how they'll _make money_.

### Why are they wasting their time on rare disease?

Because collectively they are not rare. More people have rare diseases than
cancers[^1]. And many rare diseases, once diagnosed, are easy to treat.

So if doctors could diagnose them... 

...you get the idea.

## <a name="highlights"></a> Some of my highlights

Rare disease diagnosis is so big and messed up that it literally kept me jacked
for years. It's shamefully sadistic, I know. But that didn't stop us trying to
tackle we every problem a doctor came to us with. I had lots of fun doing it.
Here are some of my favourites:

### When world experts :heart:'d our rare disease search engine

Shortly after joining, I prototyped a search engine for specialist clinicians.
These doctors see the some of the most difficult patients, who have been
undiagnosed and bouncing around the healthcare system for years.

In 2016 I went to visit some specialists at St. George's Hospital in Tooting
to show them our work. They stopped short of laughing me out of the room. I
don't think they had ever seen something like that before, a computer
scientist from a private company trying to help.

They seemed confused. I was confused.

Anyway, we went away and made it better. Got some more medical input and then
tested it in Spanish and American hospitals.

Everyone loved it! They told us about the diagnoses they'd found through it.
They wanted be our advisors. Pharmas paid to slap their logos on it.

Then we released it, did some SEO and then thousands of doctors started using it.

That felt good.

### Working on Genomics England data 🧬

Everyone knows genetics is :fire:. Rare disease happens to be one of the main
areas of focus for clinical genetics.

Before long, a research institution called RDConnect reached out for a
collaboration. We ended up adapting our search engine to help their researchers
analyse genetic sequences. Turns out this is a good idea.

We were given access to the 100k Genome Project, just the biggest deal in
genomics at the time of writing, to play with.

That felt good.

### Working with the NHS 👩‍⚕️

Like any other Brit, I have this insane love for the crumbling, bureaucratic,
(perhaps insecure?) NHS. It's free, everyone is heroically optimistic and if you
want to have any health impact in the UK it kinda has to be through them.

But only massive quangos work with the NHS, and it's almost a prerequisite that
the work has to be extremely dull. So when our pokey little group of medical
researchers and computer scientists were introduced to senior NHS staff, I was
in shock.

Not only that, it was to work on Electronic Health Records (EHR). EHR research
is :fire::fire::fire:. Until recently they've been the most expensive,
overrated, glorified accounting software known to man. But researchers, and now
Mendelian, are making them actually benefit patients.

That felt good.

### Starting a public research project :microscope:

So I am a [P.I.](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/2020/01/machine-learning-for-rare-disease-pattern-recognition-and-analysis/) now.

For those who don't know, a principal investigators are normally fairly high up
on the academic career ladder.

I know this is not the same. But it felt good when I read it.

I pitched that research project at a workshop and all the researchers went crazy.
It was oversubscribed and the organiser had to rebalance the workshop groups.

We now have an incredible group of researchers and I'm going to try my best to
get some great work published.

## Moving on

I'm guessing that was Stefan Zweig.

At the age of 23, I was in a miserable place. My first company had whimpered out
of existence and the world made no sense to me. And I was struggling to see how
a Computer Scientist could be anything but subservient to today's banking and 
advertising overlords.

Mendelian seemed ridiculous to me because it was a tech company *and* it seemed
civilised. You know, a company that doesn't make your heart sink when you think
about the future.

As is customary, the founders offered that I work for pennies in a freezing
basement. An offer that I simply couldn't refuse.

[4 years later and this is no longer true. I'm not in a basement and my bubble
is civilised]

Almost 4 years later, an eerie comfort crept up on me. Comfortable because all
of a sudden you realise that you _know_ what you are doing. And you feel at home
surrounded by other "social impact" startups and the public services. Eerie
because I'd stopped learning. And from my safe little perch, I could only watch
all of the exciting opportunities go by while I plugged away at Rare Disease.

I became restless and left. Mendelian will no doubt have countless more stories.
I'll try to remain a part of them. And I'll try to make others of my own.

[^1]: Figures from cancerresearchuk.org and raredisease.org.uk (accessed 29th October 2018), you can extrapolate that in 2013 there were 2.2m live cancer patients and 3.7m with rare disease.
