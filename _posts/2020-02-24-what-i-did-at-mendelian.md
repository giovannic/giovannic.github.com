Some kind of intro about why I'm writing this and what you can take from it

## What Mendelian does as a company

Mendelian provides R&D for software to speed up rare disease diagnosis.

I get it, you still don't understand. What's the product? Where does the money
come from? Why do they care about rare disease?

## Some of my highlights

As a mission driven group we did more than 

### When world experts :heart:'d our rare disease search engine

When I first went to meet a Genetic councillor I was short of laughed out of the
room.

Have a look at Mendelian's advisor page

We were sponsored by pharma

### Collaborating with Genomics England 🧬

RDConnect

### Working with the NHS 👩‍⚕️

It's unprecedented for a small team to have so much data, to get 1M innovate UK
funding, to build impactful tools (not just communications).

### Starting a public research project :microscope:

So I am a Principal Investigator now.

## Being a CTO

Being a CTO is different for different people and different companies.

### Documenting

If you don't document, you don't get fun stuff. In a small company, this can
fall onto you.

### Pitching

The gate-keepers in healthcare have no idea about tech.

### Hiring

This is the craziest thing.

### Still doing R&D

You have to do something that you are passionate about. This is mine.

Some would argue that I'm not cut out to be a CTO. I would argue that the right
idea hasn't come around yet.

Funnily enough, this leads me to my next section.

At the age of 23, I was in a miserable place. My company had slipped quietly out
of existence and everyone around me seemed to be devoting their lives to
nonsense. I was at a loss.

When the founder at Mendelian let me work for pennies in his freezing basement,
I couldn't believe my luck. He had given me a way out, a living doing something
I could be proud of. I am forever grateful.

Almost 4 years later, exposed to the inspiring work in health policy, renewable
energies and social data sciences, both in the public and private spheres, I am
ready to go out and lead something of my own again.go out and lead something of
my own again.
