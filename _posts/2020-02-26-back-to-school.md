This time last year I was alone in an AirBnB on the outskirts of Edinburgh. I
was escaping from work because my career, and life in general, felt quite
disappointing.

That was quite quickly forgotten when I decided to apply for a PhD. I fired off
emails to about 10 supervisors asking to meet.

In the first month I could talk about nothing else. Spending long nights
ruminating over projects was one of the best parts of that winter.

But my inbox received nothing but recruitment emails. And so my buzz fizzled out
my clear plans became crazy person dreams and the disappointment returned.

As I waited for the academic cycle to start again. A bunch of PhD grads and
researchers tried to deter me for about 8 months.

One student was super nice. Thank you.

In October, I went to visit 2 supervisors who treated me like dirt and/or
pummelled me into the ground with condescension.

My first rejection came in December, which I took quite personally.

A week later I found out that my referee hadn't submitted their reference,
despite me following up with them twice.

Then I found a pair of angels, co-supervisors who actually responded to emails.
I kept my expectations low because the project and their profiles looked _too_
good and, in my limited experience, the accomplished supervisors were the worst.

But they believed in me! We started mapping out funding options almost
immediately, they proofread my project proposal, and even gave me interview
practice.

I got an interview. But the dates coincided with a family trip to Chile to see
my brother, right in the middle of our trip to the Atacama desert.

I'm still in Santiago. My family went to Atacama but I was too invested to risk
having bad wifi for the video call. Plus they were incredibly distracting.

Now I have the scholarship with my angel supervisors on the perfect project :)
