It's jokes. At every health conference, someone will complain about the great
tech talent drought. There is so much to do, great strides being made and
technical skills are revered. I highly recommend getting involved if you have a
tech background.

Some things may vary from other sectors.

### Security & Documentation

I was broken in the hard way. "This session timeout is too long". "You
can't tell the user _why_ their authentication failed". "We don't like your rate
limiting policy for this endpoint". I had spent weeks mediating a series of
increasingly tedious arguments between an external pen tester and our UX
designer. After that, we had a torrent of confused and locked out users to
appease. But by the end, the bureaucrats had won me over.

Yes, it stifles creativity.

Yes, the required levels of security make for stupid and cumbersome systems.

Yes, it is redundant work.

But all the gatekeepers are paranoid and I don't see any way around it.

It's no wonder that most health tech is rubbish.

But if you're clever about it, you can be less uncreative, oafish and
inefficient than everyone else. And to this end, we took great pride. Codify
your infrastructure, set up your internal networking and centralised logging
early, document it once and adapt it for the millions of requests you are going
to get.

The annoying part is that if you follow standard practice, you are doing more
than most. After 6 months of begging for data, your client with the 15 ISO, NISC,
certifications will email your credentials in plain text, CC'ing almost every
employee from both companies. When you try to download the data you'll have to
placate `sftp` since it's screaming at how out of date your partner's ciphers
and protocols are.

This is getting better.

### Pitching

There are so many different backgrounds to cater for and it gets political very
quickly.

When you pitch at a tech event, tech people will ask you what stack you use and
investors will ask you how much money you're making. Everyone will clap and you
can go home.

When you pitch at a health event, (takes deep breath)

 * doctors will ask you about the status of your randomised control trial,
 * health researchers will ask you about p-values (or whatever their metric of
   the month is, whether it is applicable or not),
 * policy makers will ask you to reframe everything you said in terms of
   patient outcomes,
 * ethicists will ask you about your GDPR processing conditions,
 * pharmaceutical representatives will ask you to live code their work for them
   on the spot,
 * patients will slap on the praise before asking when you are going to replace
   doctors,
 * NHS staff will slap on the praise before asking you when you would free to
   talk in three months time

then the solitary tech guy will ask you about your stack and a clueless
investor will ask you about money. Everyone will clap and there will be too many
follow up questions to ever go home.

I personally like this. People seem to recognise the importance of what you are
doing care about the effect you have on the ecosystem. But not every computer
scientist may be up to it.

### Hiring

Nobody can do anyone else's work. I've sometimes looked at a project manager and
thought, "I could do that". Or at an infrastructure person and thought, "surely
I could use lambda instead of hassling you". Now, when your team is made up of
doctors, health economists, pharma consultants as well as machine learning
experts and computer scientists, 

In that kind of environment, there's no space for obtuse or suspect
personalities. Even if they _are_ talented. There are a bunch of those about.

So hiring is harder. But 

### Still doing R&D

You have to do something that you are passionate about. This is mine.

Some would argue that I'm not cut out to be a CTO. I would argue that the right
idea hasn't come around yet.
