I am extremely lucky to be part of a group that regularly talks about such
things. I left humbled but satisfied. It tickles that part of me that needs the
world to be wider than coronavirus, Trump and Brexit.

Here a few of the things I found most interesting from the night. I offer no
advice or information. Because...

Instead I offer collection of curious things that were new to me.

# Should we strive to eradicate suffering? Or is there value within it?

> "You are a soul in heaven waiting to be allocated a life on Earth. It is late Friday afternoon, and you watch anxiously as the supply of available lives dwindles. When your turn comes, the angel in charge offers you a choice between two lives, that of the composer Joseph Haydn and that of an oyster. Besides composing some wonderful music and influencing the evolution of the symphony, Haydn will meet with success and honour in his own lifetime, be cheerful and popular, travel and gain much enjoyment from field sports. The oyster's life is far less exciting. Though this is rather a sophisticated oyster, its life will consist only of mild sensual pleasure, rather like that experienced by humans when floating very drunk in a warm bath. When you request the life of Haydn, the angel sighs, ‘I'll never get rid of this oyster life. It's been hanging around for ages. Look, I'll offer you a special deal. Haydn will die at the age of seventy-seven. But I'll make the oyster life as long as you like...’" - [Roger Crisp (Mill on Utilitarianism, 1997)](https://www.utilitarianism.com/haydn-oyster.html)

Everyone picks Haydn. Obviously!

How about if we make this story more realistic? He suffered like a normal human
being. I'm sure he experienced the jealousy, failure, [beatings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Haydn#Struggles_as_a_freelancer),
[loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Haydn#Retirement,_illness,_and_death)....
Whereas the [Turritopsis dohrnii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turritopsis_dohrnii)
spends eternity in tropical waters experiencing, just a guess here, mild sensual pleasure.

Does that change things? Obviously not. But it makes me wonder what we are
suffering for. And if at times I should be more jellyfish-like.
