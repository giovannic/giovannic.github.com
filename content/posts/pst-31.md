I really enjoyed this one. Everyone knew what they wanted to talk about and had
lots to say. It was like no work meeting ever.

And despite all my advocating for the devil, I was met with simple, grounded
responses. It was very comforting, especially in these times.

## How open is too open

Recently, I've questioned what the right amount of openness in my work is. There
have been a [few](https://github.com/mrc-ide/covid-sim/issues/165)
[reminders](https://github.com/mrc-ide/covid-sim/issues/209) of the silly
side of Open Source. And the [mild insanity](https://i.redd.it/rvr3nja0e3z41.jpg)
of the general public has been painfully apparent to us all, with the current 
high stakes pushing most to believe that the other is crazy.

The question is: when does openness stop being worth it?

It exposes us to misinterpretation, accidental or malicious. None of it
avoidable. If governments and scientists make all decisions open for scrutiny
by a mildly insane mob, then they'll either be paralysed indefinitely or drive
us all into the ground. Sound familiar?

But if, on the other extreme, they keep everything to themselves, then we are
vulnerable to corruption. And then the conspiracy theorists lurking in the darkest
most miserable WhatsApp groups win. No one wants that.

Another point for openness is that it breeds [innovation](https://www.businessinsider.com/pandemic-outbreak-design-medical-equipment-ppe-technical-innovative-crisis-solution-2020-4). 
TL;DR, strangers band together to 3D print ventilators. Just the latest in a
long line of articles on open, feel-good, come-together badassery. 

So how do we judge the value of openness in a changing climate?

The obvious answer is, think it through on a case by case basis and don't mess
up. And there's nothing wrong with that. It seems to work most of the time.

But perhaps organisational structure can play a role too. There was an
interesting reference made to the [TEAL organisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teal_organisation).
It outlines a new way to structure an organisation to overcome the limits of
hierarchy and to give everyone a voice. It proposes principles like "self-management",
where individuals use peer relationships to make decisions, to balance accountability and autonomy.

Which makes me wonder if there are cases where GitHub/[SAGE](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/scientific-advisory-group-for-emergencies-sage)
could be structured differently to better balance collaboration/transparency and focus.

## When to change someone's mind

This conversation was nuts because most of us wanted close friends to
tell us more about what they think of us, but then we spent the rest of it
listing the numerous hazards of giving advice.

The bet is often steep, apparently you're often staking your friendship. Who knew?

The payoff is a clean conscience and a stronger friendship. Quite attractive.

There were few extra variables to consider:

 * How close are you?
 * How bad is the decision? (Some choosing only to intervene in life or death situations!)
 * Do I need to get physical? (Sounds fun)

It felt like we all avoided advice, except very occasionally with our closest of
friends or with mortal choices. We often resort to the less invasive form of advice, life
coaching. Or working through decisions with others. A clever way to game the
unsavoury odds of giving direct advice.

That's not so bad IMO.
