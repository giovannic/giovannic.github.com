This is the 30th time we've met. And everyone knows that the colour of the 30th
anniversary is green.

This was an extra special gathering because it was virtual. We were blessed
with familiar faces and screen sharing. It worked remarkably well, we may have
happened upon a new recipe :).

So without further ado:

## Dangerous ideas and when to stop

[Chosing your baby's eye color](https://www.fertility-docs.com/programs-and-services/pgd-screening/choose-your-babys-eye-color.php), [dying in style](https://www.exitinternational.net/sarco/)...

It's hard to draw up a code of ethics in 20 minutes. But it sounded like this
group tried. They were looking for a balance of freedom of expression and a
mitigation of negative externalities.

I felt that they finished on a solution, not unlike the one we have now.
Everyone make up your own damn mind.

Well, we're not all dead yet...

## A new world order is rising?

A friend made this impressive translation of Olga Tokarczuk's take on lockdown:

> My Window to the world - A new times are coming now
>  
> Through my window, I see a white mulberry, a tree that I find fascinating and was one of the reasons I moved here. Mulberry is a generous plant - throughout the spring and summer, it feeds tens of avian families with its sweet and healthy fruit. Right now, however, the mulberry is barren, so I see a sliver of a quiet street, seldom visited by somebody walking towards a park. The weather in Wrocław is almost summerlike, the sun shines blindingly, the sky is clear blue and the air is crisp and clean. Today, during my dog-walk I saw two magpies defending their nest from an owl. The owl and I looked into each others’ eyes less than a metre apart.
>  
> I have this sense that the animals are also looking forward to seeing the events unfold.
For me, the world has been too much for a while now. Too much, too fast, too loud. I, therefore, don’t ail from the “separation anxiety” and I’m not suffering from the fact that I’m not seeing other people. I’m not upset that the cinemas are closed, I’m indifferent that shopping centres are closed. I’m only worried about all of those who have lost their jobs. When I have found out about the preventative quarantine I felt some kind of a relief and I know that many people feel alike, even though they are a bit ashamed. My introversion long stifled and maltreated by the dictate of hyperactive extroverts has dusted itself off and left the closet.
>  
> Outside, I see my neighbour, a busy lawyer, who until very recently, I used to see leaving for the courthouse with his gown draped over his shoulders. Now, adorned in baggy sweat pants, he’s struggling with a branch in his garden, looks like he’s taken up spring cleaning. I see a pair of young people walking their old dog, that’s been barely able to walk since last winter. The dog wobbles as it walks but his owners patiently accompany him, walking at their slowest pace. The rubbish lorry makes a lot of ruckus collecting the bin bags. 
>  
> Life goes on but at a completely different place. I cleared out my wardrobe and moved old newspapers to the paper recycling bin. I repotted my plants. I collected my bike from the repair shop. I enjoy cooking. Images of my childhood keep persistently come back to me, reminding of a time when there was a lot more time and it was permissible to “waste it” staring through the window for hours, watching ants or laying under the table and pretending it’s the Ark. Or reading the encyclopaedia.
>  
> Perhaps it’s that we have returned to the normal life’s rhythm? It’s not the virus that is the aberration of the normal, but exactly the opposite - the hectic world preceding the virus was abnormal?
>  
> Coronavirus reminded of what we tried to forget about - that we are frail beings, made out of the most fragile matter. That we die, that we are mortal.
>  
> That we are not separated from the world by our humanity and specialness and that, instead, the world is a big network within which we are set, connected to other beings via invisible strands of dependencies and influences. That we are intertwined and despite our faraway origins, the language we speak and what colour our skin is, we fall ill all the same, we fear all the same and we die all the same. It has made us realise that regardless of how weak and defenceless we feel in the face of danger, there are people around us who are even weaker and need help. It has reminded us how fragile are our old parents and grandparents and how much they deserve our care.
>  
> It has shown us that our fervent mobility is dangerous to our world. And has recalled the same question that we very rarely feel brave enough to ask - what are we actually looking for? The fear of the disease has turned us back from a looping round and by necessity reminded us of the existence of nests that we come from and where we feel safe. And even if we had been no matter how great travellers, then in a situation like this we would always return to some home.
>  
> With that, sad truths become apparent - that in the moment of crisis, the thinking in closed and exclusive terms of nations and borders makes a return. In this difficult time, it turned out how weak in practice the idea of the European community is. European Union has forfeited the game, delegating the decision making in the time of crisis to the national governments. I see the closure of national borders to be the greatest defeat of this miserable time - old egoism and categories of “us” and “alien have made a return - the very thing that we tried to eradicate hoping that it would never format our minds again. The fear of virus has brought back automatically the simplest atavistic conviction that the ones responsible are some “others and that they always bring with peril. In Europe the virus is from “somewhere else, it’s not ours, it’s alien. In Poland, everyone coming back from abroad is now suspect.
>  
> The wave of borders snapped shut, monstrous queues at border crossing have certainly been a shock to many young people. The virus reminds: the borders exist and are alive and well.
>  
> I’m worried that the virus will quickly remind us of another old truth - how very much unequal we are. Some of us will jet-set in their private aircraft to their island homes or woodland retreats, others will remain in cities to maintain the power plants and water utilities. Others will risk their lives working in shops and hospitals. Some will use the epidemic to make riches, others will lose the fruits of their lives’ work. The incoming crisis will likely shake the rules that we previously deemed stable; many countries will not best it and in the midst of the chaos new world orders will rise; as it often is the case after a crisis. We stay at home, read books and watch tv, but in reality, we’re preparing for the great battle for the new reality, which we cannot even conceive, slowly realising that nothing is going to be the same as before. The obligatory quarantine and garrisoning of the family at home can make us realise something that we do not want to admit - that the family exhaust us and that marital bonds have burned out a long time ago. Our kids will exit the quarantine addicted to the internet and many of us will realise the pointlessness and aridity of the situation that they are stuck in by the force of inertia. What if we note an increase in the number of murders, suicides and cases of mental illness?

I love it. It's soothing and balanced. And most of those present shared her
optimism. 

Despite that, I fully expect people to return to their old ways. If I'm
pleasantly surprised, then so be it.
