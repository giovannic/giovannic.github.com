This time last year I was alone in an AirBnB on the outskirts of Edinburgh. I
was escaping from work because my life in general was quite disappointing.

That was quite quickly forgotten when I decided to apply for a PhD. I fired off
emails to about 10 supervisors asking to meet.

In the first month I could talk about nothing else. Spending long nights
ruminating over projects was one of the best parts of that winter. Drinking to
forget is only fun the first 10 times.

But my inbox got nothing but recruitment emails. So my buzz fizzled out,
my future plans became crazy person dreams, and the disappointment returned.

I waited for the academic cycle to start again. For about 8 months, most PhD
grads and researchers thought it was better to fix my delusions than to help.

One student was super nice.

In October, I went to visit two supervisors who treated me like dirt and/or
pummelled me into the ground with condescension.

My first rejection came in December, which I took quite personally.

A week later I found out that my referee hadn't submitted their reference,
despite me following up with them twice.

Then I found a pair of angels, co-supervisors who actually responded to emails.
I kept my expectations low because the project and their profiles looked _too_
good and, in my limited experience, the accomplished supervisors were the worst.

But they believed in me! We started mapping out funding options almost
immediately, they proofread my project proposal, and even gave me interview
practice.

I got an interview. But the dates were right in the middle of my family trip to
Chile to visit my brother.

I'm still in Santiago. My family went to Atacama but I was too invested to risk
having bad wifi for the video call. Plus they were incredibly distracting.

Now I have the scholarship with my angel supervisors on the perfect project :)
